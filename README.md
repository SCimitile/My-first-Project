# My-first-Project
In this project i am going to be using my skills on HTML.
By the end of it i shall have demostrated myself that i am able to properly use the basic features of
this lenguage and therefore that i am ready to move on into a new horizon: CSS, in order to integrate it to my previous knowledge and begin for real my path as a web disagner/programmer.
