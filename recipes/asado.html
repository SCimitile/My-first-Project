    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>

    <p>The photo above is the very best example of what an argentinian asado looks like.
        The <strong>"Asado argentino"</strong> (as the natives refer to it) is not just meat. 
        It is not plainly roasted by a fire, but by the embers, getting 
        that distintic smoked taste that makes it unique.
    </p>

         into a real "Asado"
